### Hi there :v: I'm Alejandro

I used to be a Data Analyst, but made the transition to Software Engineering after spending my free time, over 2 years learning about programming. Shout out to all of the great humans in tech out there who have developed and shared so much inspiring content, resources and have helped those who want to learn - including me.

:computer: Currently In-Progress:

Now, after completing multiple courses, I am an Adobe Digital Academy Scholar and my goal is to work at a creative organization where I can contribute to products that help people express themselves.

Feel free to check out my Portfolio:
